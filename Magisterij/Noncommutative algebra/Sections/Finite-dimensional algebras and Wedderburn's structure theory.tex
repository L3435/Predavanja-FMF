\subsection{Free algebras}

\datum{2023-10-5}

\begin{definicija}
Let $R = K \skl{x, y}$ be a free algebra and
$F = \set{xy - yx - 1}$. The quotient
\[
\mathcal{A}_1(K) = \kvoc{R}{(F)}
\]
is called the \emph{first Weyl algebra}\index{first Weyl algebra}.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
The first Weyl algebra is generated by elements $\oline{x}$ and
$\oline{y}$ that satisfy
$\oline{x} \cdot \oline{y} - \oline{y} \cdot \oline{x} - 1$.
\end{opomba}

\begin{opomba}
The first Weyl algebra is the algebra of differential operators --
for $D, L \colon K[y] \to K[y]$, defined as $D(p) = \parc{p}{y}$
and $L(p) = yp$, we have $DL - LD = I$.
\end{opomba}

\begin{definicija}
Let $R$ be a ring and $\sigma \in \End(R)$. The
\emph{skew polynomial ring}\index{skew polynomial ring} is the set
\[
R[x, \sigma] =
\setb{\sum_{i=0}^n b_i x^i}{n \in \N \land b_i \in R}
\]
in which for all $b \in R$ the equality $x b = \sigma(b) x$ holds.
\end{definicija}

\begin{definicija}
Let $R$ be a ring and $\sigma$ a
derivation\footnote{$\sigma(a+b) = \sigma(a) + \sigma(b)$,
$\sigma(ab) = a\sigma(b) + \sigma(a)b$.} on $R$. The
\emph{skew polynomial ring}\index{skew polynomial ring} is the set
\[
R[x, \sigma] =
\setb{\sum_{i=0}^n b_i x^i}{n \in \N \land b_i \in R}
\]
in which for all $b \in R$ the equality $x b = b x + \sigma(b)$
holds.
\end{definicija}

\subsection{Chain conditions}

\begin{definicija}
Let $C$ be a set and $\setb{C_i}{i \in I}$ a set of subsets of $C$.
The set $\setb{C_i}{i \in I}$ satisfies the
\emph{ascending chain condition}\index{ascending chain condition}
if there does not exist an infinite strictly increasing chain
\[
C_{i_1} \subset C_{i_2} \subset C_{i_3} \subset \dots
\]
The
\emph{descending chain condition}\index{descending chain condition}
is defined analogously.
\end{definicija}

\begin{definicija}
Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ an $R$-module.

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $M$ is \emph{noetherian}\index{noetherian!module} if the set
of submodules of $M$ satisfies the ascending chain condition.
\item $M$ is \emph{artinian}\index{artinian!module} if the set of
submodules of $M$ satisfies the descending chain condition.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definicija}

\begin{trditev}
The following statements are true:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item A module $M$ is noetherian if and only if each submodule of
$M$ is finitely generated.
\item Let $N \leq M$ be a submodule. Then $M$ is noetherian if and
only if both $N$ and $\kvoc{M}{N}$ are noetherian.
\label{fin_wed:prop:noet}
\item Let $N \leq M$ be a submodule. Then $M$ is artinian if and
only if both $N$ and $\kvoc{M}{N}$ are artinian.
\end{enumerate}
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
\phantom{a}
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Suppose that each submodule of $M$ is finitely generated and
$M_1 \leq M_2 \leq \dots \leq M$. Define the submodule
\[
N = \bigcup_{j \in \N} M_j.
\]
By assumption, $N$ is finitely generated. But then there exists
some $j \in \N$ such that $M_j$ contains all generators of $N$,
so $M_j = N$. Therefore, the chain cannot be strictly increasing.

Now assume that $M$ is noetherian and let $N \leq M$ be a
submodule. Define
\[
\mathcal{C} = \setb{S \leq N}{\text{$S$ is finitely generated}}.
\]
This set must have some maximal element $N_0 \leq N$. Suppose
$N_0 < N$ and consider some element $b \in N \setminus N_0$. The
module $N + Rb$ is also finitely generated and contained in $N$,
which is a contradiction as $N_0$ was maximal. Therefore we must
have $N = N_0$ and $N$ is finitely generated.

\item Suppose that $M$ is noetherian. Consider the following short
exact sequence:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & N \arrow[r, "f"] &
M \arrow[r, "g"] & \kvoc{M}{N} \arrow[r] & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
It is easy to see that $N$ is also noetherian, as the inclusion of
a chain in $N$ is also a chain in $M$. As preimages of submodules
are also submodules, the same conclusion follows for $\kvoc{M}{N}$.

Now suppose that both $N$ and $\kvoc{M}{N}$ are noetherian and
consider a chain $M_1 \leq M_2 \leq \dots \leq M$ of submodules.
As $f^{-1}(M_i)$ and $g(M_i)$ form increasing chains in their
respective modules, it follows that there exists some $n \in \N$
such that both $f^{-1}(M_i)$ and $g(M_i)$ are constant for all
$i \geq n$. Now consider the following diagram:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] &
f^{-1}(M_n) \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "\id"] &
M_n \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, hook, "i"] &
g(M_n) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\id"] &
0 \\
0 \arrow[r] &
f^{-1}(M_i) \arrow[r, "f"] &
M_i \arrow[r, "g"] &
g(M_i) \arrow[r] &
0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
By the short five lemma, $i$ is an isomorphism, so $M_n = M_i$.
\item Same as~\ref{fin_wed:prop:noet}. \qedhere
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\datum{2023-10-12}

\begin{definicija}
A ring $R$ is \emph{left-noetherian}\index{noetherian!ring} if it
is noetherian as a left $R$-module. We analogously define
\emph{right-noetherian}, \emph{left-artinian}\index{artinian!ring}
and \emph{right-artinian} rings.

A ring $R$ is \emph{noetherian}, if it is both left-noetherian and
right-noetherian. We similarly define \emph{artinian} rings.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
A ring $R$ is left-noetherian if and only if each left ideal of $R$
is finitely generated.
\end{opomba}

\begin{trditev}
If $R$ is a noetherian ring and $M$ is a finitely generated
$R$-module, $M$ is noetherian.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
As $M$ is finitely generated, there exists an endomorphism
$\varphi \colon R^n \to M$ for some $n \in \N$. Consider the short
exact sequence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & R \arrow[r] & R^n \arrow[r] & R^{n-1} \arrow[r] & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
By induction on $n$, $R^n$ is noetherian. As $M$ is a quotient of
$R^n$, $M$ is also noetherian.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Simple modules}

\begin{definicija}
A non-trivial $R$-module $M$ is \emph{simple}\index{simple!module}
if it has no proper non-trivial submodules. An $R$-module $M$ is
\emph{cyclic}\index{cyclic module} with generator $m \in M$ if
$M = R \cdot m$.
\end{definicija}

\begin{trditev}
For $R$-modules $M$, the following are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The module $M$ is simple.
\item The module $M$ is cyclic and its every non-zero element is a
generator.
\item We have $M \cong \kvoc{R}{I}$ for some maximal left ideal
$I \edn R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $M$ is simple. Then for every
$m \in M \setminus \set{0}$, $Rm \leq M$ is a non-trivial
submodule. It follows that $m$ is a generator.

Suppose now that every non-zero element is a generator. Define the
homomorphism $\phi \colon R \to M$ with $\phi(r) = rm$. Set
$I = \ker \phi = \ann(m)$. By the isomorphism theorem, we have
$Rm = M \cong \kvoc{R}{I}$. There is bijective correspondence
between ideals $I \edn J \edn R$ and submodules of $M$. As any
element of a proper submodule cannot generate $M$, $I$ must be
maximal.

Suppose now that $M \cong \kvoc{R}{I}$ for some maximal $I \edn R$
and suppose that $M' \leq M$ is a submodule. It follows that $M'$
corresponds to a left ideal $J$ such that $I \edn J \edn R$. Thus,
$J = I$ or $J = R$, or equivalently, $M' = M$ or $M' = (0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{posledica}
\label{fin_dim_alg:psl:vec_simp}
Let $D$ be a division ring and $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector
space over $D$. Let $R = \End_D(V)$. Then, $V$ is a simple
$R$-module.
\end{posledica}

\begin{proof}
For every $v \in V \setminus \set{0}$ we have $Rv = V$.
\end{proof}

\begin{izrek}[Schur's lemma]
\index{Schur's lemma}
Let $M$ and $N$ be simple $R$-modules and $f \colon M \to N$ a
homomorphism. Then $f$ is either and isomorphism or the zero map.
In particular, $\End_R(M)$ is a division ring.
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
Note that $\ker f \leq M$ and $\im f \leq N$. The conclusion
follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{trditev}
Let $D$ be a division ring and $V$ a $D$-module. Then,
$D \cong \End_R(V)$, where $R = \End_D(V)$.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Define a homomorphism $\Psi \colon D \to \End_R(V)$ as
$\Psi(d) = (f \mapsto df)$. It is clear that $\Psi$ is injective.
Now let $T \in \End_R(V)$ be an arbitrary endomorphism. Choose a
$v \in V \setminus \set{0}$. For any $w \in V$ there exists an
endomorphism of $V$ that sends $w$ to $v$, therefore,
$V = R \cdot v$. Every $R$-endomorphism is therefore determined
by its image on $v$. To prove that $\Psi$ is surjective, it is
hence enough to show that $Tv = d \cdot v$ for some $d \in D$.

Let $p \in R$ be a projection onto $Dv$. It is easy to check that
\[
Tv = T(p(v)) = p(T(v)) \in Dv. \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}
A finite dimensional division algebra $D$ over an algebraically
closed field $k$ is $k$ itself.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Note that, for $\alpha \in D$, $\kvoc{k(\alpha)}{k}$ is a finite
field extension, but as $k$ is algebraically closed,
$k(\alpha) = k$.
\end{proof}

\newpage

\subsection{Semisimple modules}

\begin{definicija}
A module is \emph{semisimple}\index{semisimple!module} if it is a
direct sum of simple modules.
\end{definicija}

\begin{trditev}
If an $R$-module $M$ is a sum of simple submodules $M_i$ for
$i \in I$, then $M$ is semisimple. Moreover, there exists a subset
$I' \subseteq I$ such that
\[
M = \bigoplus_{i \in I'} M_i.
\]
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Set
\[
\mathcal{I} =
\setb{J \subseteq I}{\text{$\br{M_j}_{j \in J}$ is independent}}.
\]
As $\mathcal{I}$ is a non-empty set and every chain in $M$ has an
upper bound, we can apply Zorn's lemma. Let $I'$ be a maximal
element of $\mathcal{I}$. Note that
\[
M' = \bigoplus_{i \in I'} M_i \leq M.
\]
If $M' \cap M_i = \set{0}$ for some $i \in I$, the set $I'$ is not
maximal as we can take $I' \cup \set{i}$. Therefore,
$M' \cap M_i = M_i$ for all $i$ as $M_i$ are simple modules. It
follows that $M' = M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{posledica}
If $M$ is semisimple, then so is every submodule and quotient of
$M$. Furthermore, every submodule of $M$ is a direct summand.
\end{posledica}

\begin{proof}
Let
\[
M = \bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i
\]
be a direct sum of simple modules and $M' \leq M$. The module
$\kvoc{M}{M'}$ is then generated by the images $\oline{M}_i$ of
$M_i$ under the quotient map. If $\oline{M}_i \ne \set{0}$, we have
$\oline{M}_i \cong M_i$ since $M_i$ is simple. Therefore,
$\kvoc{M}{M'}$ is a sum of modules $M_i$, and as such semisimple.
As we can write
\[
M = \br{\bigoplus_{i \in I'} M_i} \oplus M',
\]
we can write
\[
M' = \bigoplus_{i \in I \setminus I'} M_i. \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{trditev}
Let $M$ be a module such that every submodule of $M$ is a direct
summand.\footnote{We call this the \emph{complement property}.}
Then $M$ is semisimple.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Let $M' \leq M$ be a non-zero cyclic submodule, say $M' = Rm$ for
$m \ne 0$. Suppose $M'$ is not simple. By Zorn's lemma, there
exists a maximal submodule $M'' \leq M'$ with $m \not \in M''$. The
module $\kvoc{M'}{M''}$ is therefore simple. As $M'$ also has the
complement property, we can write $M' = M'' \oplus S$ for some
$S \leq M'$. Since $S \cong \kvoc{M'}{M''}$, it is a simple
submodule. In both cases, we have found a simple submodule of $M$.

Let $M_1$ be the sum of all simple submodules of $M$. Then there
exists a submodule $M_2 \leq M$, such that $M = M_1 \oplus M_2$.
If $M_2 \ne \set{0}$, by the same argument as above, $M_2$ has a
simple submodule. This is of course not possible.
\end{proof}

\newpage

\subsection{Endomorphism ring of a semisimple module}

\begin{trditev}
Let $M$ be an $R$-module, $S = \End_R(M)$ and $p, m, n \in \N$.
There is a canonical isomorphism of abelian groups
\[
\Hom_R(M^n, M^m) \cong S^{m \times n},
\]
such that the composition
\[
\Hom_R(M^n, M^m) \times \Hom_R(M^p, M^n) \to \Hom_R(M^p, M^m)
\]
corresponds to matrix multiplication. In particular,
$\End_R(M^n) \cong S^{n \times n} = M_n(S)$ is an isomorphism of
rings.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
The isomorphism is given by the map
$f \mapsto [\pi_i \circ f \circ \iota_j]_{i,j}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{opomba}
For $r \in R$ the map $T_r \colon R \to R$ given by $T_r(x) = xr$
is $R$-linear. We can therefore define a homomorphism
$\Phi \colon R \to \End_R(R)$ by $\Phi(r) = T_r$. As
$\Phi$ is injective and $f = T_{f(1)}$, we have
$\End_R(R) \cong R^{\mathsf{op}}$.
\end{opomba}

\begin{posledica}
For a division ring $D$, we have
$\End_D(D^n) = M_n(D^{\mathsf{op}})$.
\end{posledica}	

\begin{definicija}
A semisimple module has \emph{finite length}\index{finite length}
if it is a finite direct sum of simple modules.
\end{definicija}

\begin{trditev}
\label{fin_dim_alg:td:mat_prod}
If $M$ is a semisimple $R$-module of finite length, then
$\End_R(M)$ is isomorphic to a finite product of matrix rings over
division rings.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Let
\[
M \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^k M_i^{n_i}
\]
for distinct simple modules $M_i$. By Schur's lemma, we can write
\[
\End_R(M) =
\End_R \br{\bigoplus_{i=1}^k M_i} =
\prod_{i=1}^k \End_R \br{M_i^{n_i}} =
\prod_{i=1}^k M_{n_i} \br{\End_R(M_i)}. \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

\newpage

\subsection{Semisimple rings}

\begin{definicija}
A ring $R$ is \emph{semisimple}\index{semisimple!ring} if it is a
semisimple left $R$-module.
\end{definicija}

\begin{izrek}
Let $R$ be a ring. The following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The ring $R$ is semisimple.
\item Every $R$-module is semisimple.
\item Every short exact sequence of $R$-modules split.
\end{enumerate}
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $R$ is semisimple. As all $R$-modules are quotients of
a free module $R^I$, which is semisimple, all $R$-modules are
semisimple.

Suppose that every $R$-module is semisimple. As those have the
complement property, every short exact sequence splits.

Suppose that every short exact sequence splits and let $I \leq R$
be a submodule over $R$. As
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & I \arrow[r] & R \arrow[r] &
\kvoc{R}{I} \arrow[r] & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
is a short exact sequence, it splits, so $I$ is a direct summand
of $R$. It follows that $R$ has the complement property, therefore,
it is semisimple.
\end{proof}

\begin{posledica}
Suppose that $R$ is a semisimple ring. Then $R$ as an $R$-module
has finite length and any simple $R$-module is isomorphic to a
simple component of $R$.
\end{posledica}

\begin{proof}
We can write
\[
R = \bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i
\]
for simple $R$-modules $M_i$. By considering $1 \in R$, we see that
$I$ is a finite set.

Let $M$ be a simple $R$-module. As we have $M = R \cdot m$, there
exist maps $M_i \to M$. As $R \to M$ is surjective, at least one
of those maps is non-zero and therefore an isomorphism by Schur's
lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{trditev}
Let $D$ be a division ring and $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector
space over $D$. Then $R = \End_D(V)$ is semisimple.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
The map $f \mapsto \br{f(e_1), f(e_2), \dots, f(e_n)}$ is an
isomorphism of $R$-modules $R$ and $V^n$. As $V$ is simple by
corollary~\ref{fin_dim_alg:psl:vec_simp}, $R$ is semisimple.
\end{proof}

\newpage

\subsection{Wedderburn structure theorem}

\begin{izrek}[Wedderburn]
\index{Wedderburn's theorem}
Every semisimple ring $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of
matrix rings over division rings. If $R$ is also commutative, it is
a finite direct products of fields.
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
By proposition~\ref{fin_dim_alg:td:mat_prod}, we can write
\[
R^{\mathsf{op}} \cong \End_R(R) \cong \prod_{i=1}^k M_{n_i}(D_i).
\]
It follows that
\[
R \cong
\br{\prod_{i=1}^k M_{n_i}(D_i)}^{\mathsf{op}} =
\prod_{i=1}^k M_{n_i} \br{D_i^{\mathsf{op}}}. \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

\datum{2023-10-19}

\begin{definicija}
A ring is \emph{simple}\index{simple!ring} if it has no non-trivial
proper two-sided ideals.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
Simple rings are not necessarily semisimple.
\end{opomba}

\begin{opomba}
Every semisimple ring $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of
simple rings.
\end{opomba}

\begin{trditev}[Uniqueness of the decomposition]
Suppose that
\[
R = \prod_{i=1}^n R_i = \prod_{i=1}^m R_i'
\]
for simple rings $R_i$ and $R_i'$. Then, $n = m$ and $R_i'$ are a
permutation of $R_i$.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
As $R_i \edn R$, we have $R_i R = R_i$. It follows that
\[
R_i = \prod_{j=1}^m R_i R_j'.
\]
Take $R_i R_j' \edn R_i$ to be a non-trivial ideal. It follows that
$R_i R_j' = R_i$. Likewise, it follows that $R_i R_j' = R_j'$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Jacobson radical}

\begin{definicija}
The \emph{Jacobson radical}\index{Jacobson radical} of a ring $R$
is the set
\[
\rad R = \bigcap \setb{I \edn_L R}{\text{$I$ is maximal in $R$}}.
\]
\end{definicija}

\begin{lema}
\label{fin_dim_alg:lm:jac_rad}
For all $y \in R$ the following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item We have $y \in \rad R$.
\item For all $x \in R$ the element $(1-xy)$ is left invertible.
\item For all simple $R$-modules $M$ we have $yM = (0)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $y \in \rad R$. If there exists some $x \in R$ such
that $(1 - xy)$ is not left invertible, the set $R (1 - xy)$ is a
proper ideal of $R$. By Zorn's lemma, there exists some maximal
ideal $M \edn R$ such that $R (1 - xy) \leq M$. In particular, we
have $1 - xy \in M$. As $y \in M$, we have $1 \in M$, which is of
course not possible.

Suppose that $(1 - xy)$ is left invertible for all $x \in R$. If
we have $ym \ne 0$ for an element $m \in M$ of a simple $R$-module,
we get $R(ym) = M$. Therefore, there exists some $x \in R$ such
that $xym = m$, or, equivalently, $(1 - xy) \cdot m = 0$. This is
again a contradiction.

Suppose now that $y$ annihilates all simple $R$-modules and let
$M \edn R$ be any maximal ideal. As $\kvoc{R}{M}$ is a simple
$R$-module, we get $y \cdot \kvoc{R}{M} = (0)$, therefore,
$y \in M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definicija}
The \emph{annihilator}\index{annihilator} of an $R$-module $M$ is
the set
\[
\ann(M) = \setb{y \in R}{y \cdot M = (0)}.
\]
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
We have $\ann M \edn R$.
\end{opomba}

\begin{posledica}
We have
\[
\rad R = \bigcap \setb{\ann M}{\text{$M$ is a simple $R$-module}}.
\]
In particular, $\rad R \edn R$.
\end{posledica}

\begin{lema}
An element $y \in R$ is an element of the Jacobson radical if and
only if $1 - xyz$ is invertible for all $x, z \in R$.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
If $1 - xy \cdot 1$ is invertible, we have $y \in \rad R$.

Suppose now that $y \in \rad R$ and fix $x, z \in R$. As
$yz \in \rad R$, the element $1 - xyz$ is left invertible with
inverse $u \in R$. But as $xyz \in \rad R$, we also have that the
element $1 + u \cdot (xyz) = u$ is left invertible.
\end{proof}

\begin{trditev}
The following statements are true:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The set $\rad R$ is the largest (left) ideal $J$ satisfying
$1 + J \subseteq R^{-1}$.
\item The left radical is the same as the right radical.
\item Suppose that $I \edn R$ is an ideal with
$I \subseteq \rad R$. Then
\[
\rad \br{\kvoc{R}{I}} = \kvoc{\rad R}{I}.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Maximal left ideals in $\kvoc{R}{I}$ correspond with maximal left
ideals in $R$ which contain $I$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definicija}
A ring $R$ is \emph{J-semisimple}\index{J-semisimple module} if
$\rad R = (0)$.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
For each ring $R$, the quotient $\kvoc{R}{\rad R}$ is J-semisimple.
\end{opomba}

\begin{trditev}
The following statements are true:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $R$ and $\kvoc{R}{\rad R}$ have the same simple left modules.
\item An element $x \in R$ is (left) invertible if and only if
$x + \rad R$ is (left) invertible in $\kvoc{R}{\rad R}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
\phantom{a}
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Follows from lemma~\ref{fin_dim_alg:lm:jac_rad}.
\item If $x$ is invertible, then so is $x + \rad R$. Suppose now
that for some $y \in R$ we have
$(y + \rad R) (x + \rad R) = 1 + \rad R$. As $1 - yx \in \rad R$,
we have that $yx$ is invertible, so $x$ has a left inverse.
\qedhere
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{definicija}
A one-sided or two-sided ideal $I \subseteq R$ is

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item \emph{nil}\index{nil ideal} if all its elements are
nilpotent,
\item \emph{nilpotent}\index{nilpotent ideal} if $I^n = (0)$ for
some $n \in \N$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definicija}

\begin{lema}
If a left ideal $I \subseteq R$ is nil, then $I \subseteq \rad R$.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Fix an element $y \in I$. For all $x \in R$, the element $xy \in I$
is nilpotent, say $(xy)^n = 0$. As
\[
(1 - xy) \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (xy)^k = 1,
\]
the element $1 - xy$ is invertible. Therefore, $y \in \rad R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{izrek}
Suppose that $R$ is a left-artinian ring. Then $\rad R$ is the
largest nilpotent left
ideal.\footnote{Also the \emph{Wedderburn radical}.}
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
As every nilpotent ideal is contained in the radical, it suffices
to show that $\rad R$ is nilpotent.

Consider the decreasing chain
\[
R \supseteq \rad R \supseteq (\rad R)^2 \supseteq \dots
\]
As $R$ is artinian, this chain is eventually constant -- call that
ideal $I$. Assume that $I \ne (0)$. By the artinian property, there
exists a minimal left ideal $I_0$ such that $I \cdot I_0 \ne 0$.
Therefore, there exists some $a \in I_0$ such that
$I \cdot a \ne (0)$. Then $I \cdot (Ia) = Ia \ne (0)$. It follows
that $I \cdot a = I_0$. In particular, for some $y \in I$ we have
$ya = a$, or $(1-y) a = 0$. As $y \subseteq \rad R$, we get
$a = 0$, which is a contradiction, therefore $I = (0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{izrek}
For a ring $R$ the following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The ring $R$ is semisimple.
\item The ring $R$ is J-semisimple and left-artinian.
\end{enumerate}
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
A semisimple ring is left-artinian by the Wedderburn theorem. Since
$R$ is semisimple, there exists a left $R$-module $I \leq R$ such
that $R = \rad R \oplus I$. If $\rad R \ne (0)$, $I$ is a proper
ideal and therefore contained in a maximal ideal $M$. But as
$\rad R$ is also contained in the same ideal $M$, it follows that
$R \subseteq M$, which is impossible.

Now suppose that $R$ is J-semisimple and left-artinian. By
the artinian property, we can write $\rad R$ as a finite
intersection of maximal submodules
\[
(0) = \rad R = \bigcap_{i=1}^n M_i.
\]
Consider the homomorphism
\[
\varphi \colon R \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \kvoc{R}{M_i}
\]
with
\[
\varphi(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x + M_i).
\]
As $\ker \varphi = (0)$, it is injective. We can therefore write
\[
R \leq \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \kvoc{R}{M_i},
\]
so $R$ is semisimple.
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}[Nakayama]
For a left ideal $J \leq R$ the following statements are
equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $J \subseteq \rad R$
\item The only finitely generated $R$-module $M$ such that
$JM = M$ is $M = (0)$.
\item For all $R$-modules $N$ and $M$ such that $N \leq M$ and
$\kvoc{M}{N}$ is finitely generated, we have
\[
N + J M = M \implies N = M.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $J \subseteq \rad R$ and that $M \ne (0)$ is finitely
generated with a minimal set of generators $\set{x_1, \dots, x_k}$.
Since $J \cdot M = M$, we can write
\[
x_k = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i x_i
\]
for some $a_i \in J$. But as $1 - a_k$ is invertible, we can
express $x_k$ as a linear combination of $x_1$, $x_2$, \dots,
$x_{k-1}$, which is a contradiction.

Suppose that the second statement holds and let $N \leq M$ be
modules. If $N \ne M$, it follows that
$J \cdot \kvoc{M}{N} \ne \kvoc{M}{N}$, so $N + JM \ne M$.

No suppose that the third statement holds and let
$y \in J \setminus \rad R$. Let $M$ be a maximal submodule of $R$
such that $y \not \in M$. As $M + J = R$, it follows that $M = R$,
which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Group rings and Maschke's theorem}

\begin{izrek}[Maschke]
\index{Maschke's theorem}
Suppose that $G$ is a finite group and $k$ a field such that
$\chr k \nmid \abs{G}$. Then $kG$ is semisimple.
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
By Algebra 3, theorem~4.2.2, every submodule $W$ of $V$ is a direct
summand, so $kG$ has the complement property.
\end{proof}

\begin{trditev}
If $k$ is a field and $G$ is an infinite group, then $kG$ is not
semisimple.
\end{trditev}

\begin{proof}
Consider the map $\varepsilon \colon kG \to k$ such that
$\eval{\varepsilon}{k}{} = \id$ and $\varepsilon(g) = 1$ for all
$g \in G$. Let $I = \ker \varepsilon$ and note that $I \edn kG$.

Suppose that $kG$ is semisimple. Therefore, there exists a
submodule $J \leq kG$ such that $I \oplus J = kG$. Write
$1 = e + f$ where $e \in I$ and $f \in J$. As $e = e^2 + ef$, it
follows that $ef = 0$ and $e = e^2$. Similarly, we have $f = f^2$.
Analogously, we get that $b = be$ for all $b \in I$, so $I = (kG)e$
and $J = (kG)f$.

Note that for all $g \in G$ we have $g - 1 \in I$, so $gf = f$. It
is now clear that $f \ne 0$ must have the same non-zero coefficient
in front of every element $g \in G$ in its linear combination of
elements of $G$. This is not possible, as the linear combination is
finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{opomba}
The ring $\C G$ is always J-semisimple.
\end{opomba}

\begin{opomba}
If $G$ is a finite group and $\chr k \mid \abs{G}$, the ring $kG$
is also not semisimple.
\end{opomba}

These are my lecture notes on the course Functional analysis in the
year 2023/24. The lecturer that year was prof.~dr.~Igor Klep.

The notes are not perfect. I did not write down most of the examples
that help with understanding the course material. I also did not
formally prove every theorem and may have labeled some as trivial or
only wrote down the main ideas.

I have most likely made some mistakes when writing these notes --
feel free to correct them.
